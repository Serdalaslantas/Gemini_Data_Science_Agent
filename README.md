# Population Prediction Project

This project aims to analyze a population dataset and build a predictive model for 'Population2023'. 

## Project Workflow

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the population data from 'population.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset's characteristics using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and identifying potential outliers.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and outliers to prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Data Wrangling:** Transform data types, engineer new features (like 'PopulationDensity'), and save the modified DataFrame.
5. **Data Analysis:** Perform descriptive statistics and correlation analysis on the wrangled dataset.
6. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to understand relationships within the data.
7. **Feature Engineering:** Engineer new features based on existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
8. **Data Splitting:** Split the engineered dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
9. **Model Training:** Train various regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to predict 'Population2023'.
10. **Model Optimization:** Optimize hyperparameters of the trained models using GridSearchCV.
11. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the optimized models on the test set using metrics like MSE, RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.


## Key Findings

* **XGBoost** emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the lowest RMSE (1,954,798) and highest R-squared (0.996) on the test set.
* Feature engineering, including creating interaction terms and polynomial features, significantly improved model performance.
* Hyperparameter optimization further enhanced the models' predictive capabilities.


## Insights and Next Steps

* Analyze feature importance scores from the XGBoost model to understand the key drivers of population prediction.
* Explore additional feature engineering techniques to potentially further improve model accuracy.
* Consider deploying the trained model for real-world population predictions.
